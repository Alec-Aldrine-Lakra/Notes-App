# Notes-App

This Notes App has been created using yargs module which uses command line input to create new notes in the file system.
The notes are stored in a file called notes.json where every note is represented by a JSON object. Several functionalities like
display, read, and delete have been added to modify contents in the notes.json file. Another module named chalk has been implemented 
to display contents in a stylish way within the node console.
